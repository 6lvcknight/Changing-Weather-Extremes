# Changing-Weather-Extremes
By Ibukunfoluwa (Folu) Aderibigbe

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, the world has seen a significant change in climate trends, as seen through an increase in more extreme weather events. This shift offers a challenge to our understanding of climate systems and how we deal with them. The examination of meteorological data provides the knowledge of the complexity of these shifts. This study seeks to give an in-depth examination of the weather extremes by evaluating meteorological data from 2018 to 2022, with a focus on a specific region (Ontario Tech University). Through discovering these trends, anomalies, and patterns, this study would describe the current state of our climate through this method.

The meteorological variables included in this study are temperature, cloud type, dew point, relative humidity, precipitable water, wind speed, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. These variables provide the general behaviour of weather systems. This study intends to capture the short-term fluctuations by evaluating these data over a five-year period.

One of the most important components of this research is the classification of data into four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. This seasonal method enables a more sophisticated understanding of how weather patterns change throughout the year and how these changes correspond to larger climatic changes. It also gives a framework for evaluating data over time, allowing for an assessment of whether specific weather occurrences are growing more or less prominent.

### Conclusion
The results of the study raise serious concerns about the local consequences of larger climatic trends. While the specific seasonal trends do not explicitly indicate global warming, the observed fluctuations and extreme temperature events are consistent with the projected outcomes of a warming globe. This study requires ongoing monitoring and research to fully understand the influence of climate change on regional weather patterns.
