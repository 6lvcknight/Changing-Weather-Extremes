# Changing-Weather-Extremes
By Ibukunfoluwa (Folu) Aderibigbe

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, the world has seen a significant change in climate trends, as seen through an increase in more extreme weather events. This shift offers a challenge to our understanding of climate systems and how we deal with them. The examination of meteorological data provides the knowledge of the complexity of these shifts. This study seeks to give an in-depth examination of the weather extremes by evaluating meteorological data from 2018 to 2022, with a focus on a specific region (Ontario Tech University). Through discovering these trends, anomalies, and patterns, this study would describe the current state of our climate through this method.

The meteorological variables included in this study are temperature, cloud type, dew point, relative humidity, precipitable water, wind speed, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. These variables provide the general behaviour of weather systems. This study intends to capture the short-term fluctuations by evaluating these data over a five-year period.

One of the most important components of this research is the classification of data into four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. This seasonal method enables a more sophisticated understanding of how weather patterns change throughout the year and how these changes correspond to larger climatic changes. It also gives a framework for evaluating data over time, allowing for an assessment of whether specific weather occurrences are growing more or less prominent.

### 2.1 Data Collection

The foundation of this study is built upon the collection of meteorological data from NSRDB: National Solar Radiation Database. This station provided a reliable and consistent source of data throughout the 24-year period under investigation. The data encompassed a wide range of meteorological variables, including temperature, cloud type, dew point, relative humidity, precipitable water, wind speed, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. These variables were carefully selected to offer a holistic view of weather behavior and trends.

### 2.2 Data Analysis

The collected data was subjected to rigorous analysis to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns. Statistical techniques, such as time series analysis, were applied to assess short-term fluctuations and seasonal variations in the meteorological variables. Data was also categorized into four distinct seasons—spring, summer, fall, and winter—to facilitate a more granular examination of how weather patterns evolved throughout the year.

### 2.3 Seasonal Classification

Seasonal classification played a pivotal role in this study, allowing for a nuanced understanding of weather patterns over time. Each season was characterized by specific meteorological features, including temperature ranges, cloud cover, and precipitation patterns. By segregating the data into seasons, the research aimed to uncover insights into how weather phenomena change throughout the year and their potential links to larger climatic shifts.

### Findings and Observations
The analysis of the meteorological data yielded several noteworthy findings and observations:

**Temperature Fluctuations:** The study identified significant fluctuations in temperature, with instances of extreme heat and cold events occurring during the study period. These temperature anomalies were consistent with the expected outcomes of a warming globe.
**Precipitation Trends:** Changes in precipitation patterns were observed, including variations in rainfall and snowfall amounts across different seasons. These trends have implications for local hydrology and water resource management.
**Wind Speed Variability:** The data indicated fluctuations in wind speed, which can impact various aspects of daily life, from agriculture to energy production.
**UV Irradiation Levels:** The study examined UV irradiation levels and their potential implications for public health and environmental factors, such as skin cancer risk and ecosystem health.
### Implications
The findings of this study have significant implications for both the local region and the broader understanding of climate change:

**Local Consequences:** The observed trends and extreme weather events raise concerns about the local consequences of larger climatic shifts. These changes can affect agriculture, infrastructure, public health, and the environment around the Ontario Tech University region.
**Global Climate Change:** While the study does not conclusively attribute the observed trends to global warming, the data aligns with the expected outcomes of a warming globe. This underscores the need for continued research and monitoring to fully comprehend the influence of climate change on regional weather patterns.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this study offers valuable insights into changing weather extremes in the Ontario Tech University region from 1998 to 2022. The comprehensive analysis of meteorological data, seasonal classification, and identification of trends provides a foundation for understanding the evolving climate in the area. However, the research calls for ongoing monitoring and further investigation to deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between local weather patterns and global climate change. This knowledge is essential for informed decision-making and the development of strategies to mitigate the potential impacts of changing weather extremes on the region's society and environment.
